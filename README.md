## Installation

Clone the repository. Run npm install within the console to install the correct dependencies required. Once that is done, you will need the database to be created and seeded. Assuming you have mysql, you are able to run mysql -u root -p, and then type your password to start mysql in the command line. You can then enter SOURCE ./db/schema.sql, and then  SOURCE ./db/seeds.sql to initialize and populate the database. Once you have completed this, you can run node index.js to begin the app. Since this is within the command line, you will need to use arrow keys along with enter to go through the menu.
